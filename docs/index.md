## Why this specialization?

Python has evolved from “nice-to-know” to **must-have** for data analysis, automation, and AI.  
Yet most learners stall after the basics because they lack structure, feedback, and real-world practice.  
This program solves that with:

* **Weekly live workshops** – coded *with* you, not at you  
* **Mini projects** that mirror workplace tasks (data dashboards, APIs, simple AI agents)  
* **Office hours + community** for questions between sessions  
* A certificate of completion recognized by QurioSkill hiring partners

## Who is this for?

| ✔ Good fit | ✘ Not ideal |
|------------|-------------|
| Professionals pivoting to data/AI roles | Those seeking advanced machine-learning research |
| Students who know *some* coding but need depth | Learners who cannot commit ~5 hrs/week |
| Career-switchers building a portfolio | Anyone wanting only theory without hands-on work |

**Prerequisites**

* Basic computer literacy  
* No prior Python required—Week 01 covers setup and fundamentals
