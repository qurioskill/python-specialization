## **Why this specialization?**

Python has become one of the most essential programming languages for today’s world—powering everything from data analysis and automation to artificial intelligence.

But learning Python on your own can feel overwhelming. Many learners get stuck after the basics, unsure of what to build next or how to apply their skills.

This specialization is designed to guide you through that next step, with:

* **Live weekly workshops** – where you’ll code *together* with an instructor, not just watch  
* **Mini projects** inspired by real-world tasks – like building dashboards, working with APIs, or exploring simple AI use cases  
* A **supportive learning environment** that keeps you motivated and moving forward  

By the end, you won’t just know Python—you’ll be using it with confidence.

## **Who is this for?**

This program is a great starting point if you're just beginning your programming journey—whether you're a student, a recent graduate, or a working professional exploring new skills.

| ✔ A great fit if you are... | ✘ Might not be the right fit if... |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Curious about how coding works in the real world | You're looking for advanced machine learning topics |
| Ready to invest ~5 hours/week to learn by doing | You can’t make time for regular practice |
| Interested in building confidence through live, hands-on sessions | You prefer only theory without coding exercises |
| Starting fresh or returning to programming after a break | You're already an experienced Python developer |

**Prerequisites**

* Basic computer literacy  
* No prior Python required—Week 01 covers setup and fundamentals
