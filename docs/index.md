## **Why this specialization?**

Python has become one of the most essential programming languages for today’s world—powering everything from data analysis and automation to artificial intelligence.

But learning Python on your own can feel overwhelming. Many learners get stuck after the basics, unsure of what to build next or how to apply their skills.

This specialization is designed to guide you through that next step, with:

* **Live weekly workshops** – where you’ll code *together* with an instructor, not just watch  
* **Mini projects** inspired by real-world tasks
* A **supportive learning environment** that keeps you motivated and moving forward  

By the end, you won’t just know Python—you’ll be using it with confidence.
