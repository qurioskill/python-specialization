# **QurioSkill Python Specialization ‚Äî Curriculum Snapshot**
_A 12‚Äëweek, hands‚Äëon program built for learners interested in python programming._

## **Learning outcomes**

**Internalize core Python concepts**‚Äîdata types, control flow, functions, and packages‚Äîwith a focus on problem decomposition and ‚Äúthinking in code.‚Äù 

We adopt a **hands-on, problem-solving** mindset: every class applies concepts to real tasks with mini-challenges, live debugging, and iterative refactoring to build fluency.

## **Topics Covered**
| Topic | One-line explainer                                                                                                       | Why it matters |
|---|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Data types | How Python represents numbers, text, booleans, lists, and dictionaries.                                                  | The right type prevents bugs and enables the correct operations from day one. |
| Functions | Bundle reusable logic with parameters and return values (e.g., `def sum(a,b):return a+b`)                                | Makes code modular, testable, and maintainable as projects grow. |
| Methods | Functions that belong to objects (e.g., `"text".upper()`, `list.append()`), including mutating vs non-mutating behavior. | Promotes idiomatic, readable code and leverages built-ins efficiently to avoid reinventing logic. |
| Loops & conditionals | Make decisions and repeat actions with `if/elif/else` and `for/while`.                                                   | Turns static scripts into dynamic programs that handle real-world variability. |
| Modules & packages | Organize code across files and reuse libraries with imports.                                                             | Keeps projects scalable and lets you leverage the wider Python ecosystem. |
| Source control (Git) | Track, branch, and merge code changes locally and on GitHub.                                                             | Enables collaboration, safe rollback, code reviews, and reliable deployment. |
| Hands-on problem solving (every class) | Apply each topic to mini real-world tasks‚Äîpair coding, debugging, and iterating on working code.                         | Reinforces concepts through practice, builds confidence, and creates portfolio-ready snippets. |
| Projects | Build small but complete tools (e.g., CLI utility, data report, API client, mini dashboard).                             | Integrates multiple concepts end-to-end and produces visible outcomes for your portfolio. |
