The right type prevents bugs and enables the correct operations from day one. Functions Bundle reusable logic with parameters and return values (e.g., <code>def sum(a,b):return a+b</code>) Makes code modular, testable, and maintainable as projects grow. Methods Functions that belong to objects (e.g., <code>\"text\".upper()</code>, <code>list.append()</code>), including mutating vs non-mutating behavior. Promotes idiomatic, readable code and leverages built-ins efficiently to avoid reinventing logic. Loops &amp; conditionals Make decisions and repeat actions with <code>if/elif/else</code> and <code>for/while</code>. Turns static scripts into dynamic programs that handle real-world variability. Modules &amp; packages Organize code across files and reuse libraries with imports. Keeps projects scalable and lets you leverage the wider Python ecosystem. Source control (Git) Track, branch, and merge code changes locally and on GitHub. Enables collaboration, safe rollback, code reviews, and reliable deployment. Hands-on problem solving (every class) Apply each topic to mini real-world tasks\u2014pair coding, debugging, and iterating on working code. Reinforces concepts through practice, builds confidence, and creates portfolio-ready snippets. Projects Build small but complete tools (e.g., CLI utility, data report, API client, mini dashboard). Integrates multiple concepts end-to-end and produces visible outcomes for your portfolio. <p>Register Now \u2192</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 Website</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 Connect on LinkedIn</p>"},{"location":"payment-value/","title":"QurioSkill Python Specialization","text":""},{"location":"payment-value/#course-overview","title":"Course Overview","text":"<ul> <li>Duration: 12 weeks (12 live workshops, 2 hours each)  </li> <li>Format: Fully hands-on, live online learning  </li> <li>Outcome: Build real-world Python skills from the ground up, ending with resume-ready projects </li> <li>Support: Direct access to your instructor \u2014 an industry professional \u2014 for questions between sessions  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"payment-value/#pricing","title":"Pricing","text":"<ul> <li>Full Price: $300 CAD total <ul> <li>$25 CAD per 2-hour class (24 total hours of instruction)  </li> <li>Includes class recordings, materials, and instructor support</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"payment-value/#why-its-worth-it","title":"Why It\u2019s Worth It","text":"<ul> <li>Affordable Learning: Comparable programs cost $1,000+ \u2014 ours is under $25/class  </li> <li>Hands-On Practice: Every session includes live coding and exercises  </li> <li>Career-Ready Skills: Graduate with projects to showcase on your resume and GitHub  </li> <li>Personal Support: Get feedback directly from an industry-experienced instructor  </li> </ul> <p>Register Now \u2192</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 Website</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 Connect on LinkedIn</p>"},{"location":"register/","title":"Register","text":"Loading\u2026"}]}
